## 🌟 Agentic Navigation Tips (@GATT)
1. **Start with `app/src/main/java/.../agentic/`** for core living-code adaptation engines
2. **Explore `ai/`** for autonomous AI personality systems and engines
3. **Check `scripts/`** for autonomous workflow and repository management
4. **Review `reference/standards/`** for agentic development principles

## 🧬 Living-Code Augmentation Features
- **LivingCodeAdapter**: Transforms static code into dynamic, self-evolving systems
- **AgenticWorkflowEngine**: Fully autonomous development workflow management
- **LivingAINativeInterface**: Intimate AI&i experience where interaction teaches the system
- **Dynamic Resource Loader**: Context-aware resource adaptation and optimization
